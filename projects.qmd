-This was a project I worked on for a class to get my first experience with data visualization with Tableau, and I chose to work with Ferris Wheels. \n

The two projects below were from a statistical computing with R class that I took. We had practice with filtering data, wrangling data, creating meaningful tables in R with the kable package, writing user-defined functions, and more.
